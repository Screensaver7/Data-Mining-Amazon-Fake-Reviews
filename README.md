# Naive Bayes with k-Fold Cross Validation

The purpose of this study is find the best accuracy out of three algorithm, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and K-means, in classifying five different datasets. We are pursuing this study to find the best algorithm out of the three to use for classification and also to examine any differences between supervised learning like Naive Bayes and Decision Tree and unsupervised procedure like K-mean.

# Usage
Must have python version 2.7.x

1. Open terminal at file location
2. Run python naivebayes.py path-to-dataset.csv 10

This starts the 10-Fold Cross Validation for Naive Bayes over path-to-dataset.csv dataset.
